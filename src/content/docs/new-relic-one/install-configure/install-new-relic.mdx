Welcome to New Relic and [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-one)!

We're an observability platform that brings in data from any of your digital sources and helps you understand what's going on in your stack, so you can make proactive and predictive improvements to your environment. We'll give you the whole picture of your applications and devices, from the container running a service in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button. With New Relic, you'll be able to build better software, and deliver value to your customers.

[Sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) (it's free, forever!), install any of our monitoring services, and start [working with your data](/docs/data-apis/get-started/nrdb-horsepower-under-hood). It's clean and fast!

## Easy install options: Quickstarts and guided install [#get-started]

Kick it off immediately with our out of the box **[New Relic Instant Observability quickstarts](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/)**, or use our **[guided install](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/cross-product-functions/install-configure/new-relic-guided-install-overview/)** to download, install, and customize the New Relic CLI and infrastructure agent.

## Install APM [#apm-install]

Use our application performance monitoring (APM) monitoring to learn about your web or non-web application's performance. We support apps for several programming languages:

* [C](/docs/agents/c-sdk/install-configure/install-c-sdk-compile-link-your-code)
* [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/get-new-relic-go)

## Install browser monitoring [#browser-install]

Browser monitoring in New Relic measures full page life cycle and session data, such as popularity and user satisfaction (Apdex) by page, JavaScript error analytics, interaction events, AJAX requests, etc.

See [browser monitoring install](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent).

## Install infrastructure monitoring [#infra-install]

We provide flexible, dynamic observability of your entire infrastructure, from a datacenter to thousands of Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure instances, or containers running in orchestrated environments. Learn the health and performance of all your hosts with application context and logs.

* [Linux guided install for infrastructure monitoring](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==)

* [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/getting-started/android-installation-configuration)
* [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/getting-started/ios-installation-configuration)

## Install synthetic monitors [#synthetics]

[Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics) allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to make sure your content is fully functional. Send scripted browser tests to your site from locations all around the world to verify your content is always up, everywhere.

Synthetics doesn't require installation, except for its [private minions](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-configure-private-minions) feature.

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

You should start seeing your data in the New Relic UI after installing the agent, generating some traffic, and waiting a few minutes. If no data appears, follow our [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data).
