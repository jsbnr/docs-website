After you import OpenTelemetry data into New Relic, you can use a variety of tools to analyze it. Take a look at these UI options:

* [Explorer](#explorer)
* [Data explorer and query builder](#query-builder)

## Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details [#explorer]

The New Relic **Explorer** tab is a good place to start gathering information about your services. It offers you a way to filter services and then filter the data to show a variety of views into your data.

### Find your service (entity) [#find-entity]

To get started in Explorer, you need to find your service:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).

2. In the left sidebar, click **Services - OpenTelemetry**:

   <img
     title="Filter for OpenTelemetry to see only those entities."
     alt="Screen capture showing how to filter for OpenTelemetry services."
     src={explorerOtelServices}
   />

3. In the center pane, click the service you want to know more about, or find your service by entering the name in the top filter bar.

### Narrow down your data with filters [#filter]

Once you have your entity, you can then filter for data from your service.

With the filter bar **Narrow data to...**, you can highlight a specific facet of the telemetry recorded for your service. For example, you may want to see the error rate for a particular version of the service that you've deployed in a canary instance, so you add a filter for `service.version='1.2.3'`.

Filters are preserved when navigating between different views of your data for a service. For example, the filter for `service.version='1.2.3'` carries over to the **Transactions** view, so that you would see telemetry on requests to the endpoints (transactions) that are running version 1.2.3 of your service, and not any other versions.

Filters are preserved when navigating between the **Summary**, **Transactions**, **Databases**, **Externals**, **Errors**, and **JVMs** views.

Filters are also preserved when navigating to the **Distributed tracing** view, but with limitations. Only filter conditions that use the equals operator ("=") are currently supported when navigating to **Distributed tracing**. If you navigate back from the **Distributed tracing** page, the filters you selected on the previous view will come back.

Once you filter your data, the UI has various views in the left-navigation pane. See our descriptions below for view details.

### Summary page [#summary]

After you click on a service in the **Explorer** tab, you see the **Summary** page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper.

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        UI area
      </th>

      <th>
        Attribute
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Response time
      </td>

      <td>
        `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Throughput
      </td>

      <td>
        `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Error rate
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
        * `otel.status_code = ERROR`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Service instances pane
      </td>

      <td>
        `service.instance.id` (usually set via the OTel resource API)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Distributed tracing [#tracing]

In **Distributed tracing**, you can locate traces and examine span details. For your trace data to appear in the New Relic UI, it needs to conform to the [OpenTelemetry trace semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions#trace-semantic-conventions). Also, in the Traces section of our [best practices](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-concepts#traces) guide, you can find some tips about making sure your traces and spans appear in New Relic.

The following attributes are typically not added explicitly to spans. Rather, they are usually set when creating a span or performing operations (for example, recording an error) on a span using the OpenTelemetry SDK.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        name
      </td>

      <td>
        A span’s name is generally set when [starting a span](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#span-creation). The name can generally be anything, but the OpenTelemetry specification provides guidance for certain types of spans like [Database spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/database.md#semantic-conventions-for-database-client-calls) or [HTTP spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#name).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [span.kind](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#spankind)
      </td>

      <td>
        A span’s kind is generally set when [starting a span](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#span-creation). New Relic uses `span.kind` to infer that a span is an entry point to a given service. When `span.kind = server` or `consumer` it is considered an entry point. When `span.kind = client` or `producer`, it is considered a call to an external service or database system.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        otel.status_code
      </td>

      <td>
        * A span’s [status is set](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#set-status) using the span API. The `otel.status_code` attribute is how it is manifested by New Relic.
        * The UI primarily uses `otel.status_code` for the purpose of identifying errors.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Find traces and their associated spans

Here are some ways to target your searches:

1. To find the traces you want, you can run queries like these in the filter bar:
   * `service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME`
   * `trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID`
2. When you find an interesting trace, click on it to display a waterfall diagram showing the spans of the trace.
3. Click on specific spans within the trace to display span details in the right panel.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For more ways to filter traces, see our [distributed tracing UI page](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui).
</Callout>

#### View spans with errors

After you click on a span in the trace waterfall view, you can see span errors in the right panel under **Error details**.

<img
  title="Screenshot showing the right pane with Error details section"
  alt="Screenshot showing the right pane with Error details section"
  src={viewSpanErrors}
/>

The error details are populated by spans containing `otel.status_code = ERROR` and display the content of `otel.status_description`.

To narrow your search for spans with errors, you can enter `otel.status_code = ERROR` directly in the distributed tracing filter bar.

#### View span events

If you send span events as described by the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#add-events), you can view them in the New Relic UI. Span events have two general types:

* Exceptions
* Non-exceptions (for example, logs)

If you have span events, links for these appear in the right pane:

1. Click on a span in the waterfall view.

2. In the right pane, click **View span events**, or you can expand **Error details** and click the link at the bottom of the errors.

   <img
     title="Screenshot showing the right pane showing the two links for span events"
     alt="Screenshot showing the right pane showing the two links for span events"
     src={viewSpanEvents}
   />

3. When you're in span events and only want to view exceptions, slide the toggle **Only show exceptions**.

<img
  title="Screenshot showing span events and how you can filter just for exceptions"
  alt="Screenshot showing span events and how you can filter just for exceptions"
  src={spanEventsExceptions}
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
  OpenTelemetry exceptions handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status.
</Callout>

### Databases [#databases]

The **Databases** page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts.

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        UI area
      </th>

      <th>
        Attribute
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Top database calls
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by span name
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Top databases (by query time)
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by `db.system`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Top databases (by throughput)
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = client` or `producer`
        * `db.system`
        * Facets by `db.system`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Errors [#errors]

On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate.

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

* `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
* `otel.status_code = ERROR`
* Facets by span name

### External services [#externals]

The external services feature captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities.

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

* `span.kind = client` or `producer`
* `db.system` is not present

For more details, see [External services](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/external-services/external-services-intro).

### JVMs [#jvms]

The JVMs page for services instrumented with OpenTelemetry allows you to identify which service instances have unusual or unhealthy performance patterns. You can choose several service instances to compare based on summaries of key metrics: response time, throughput, error rate, garbage collection time, and memory usage. Then, you can compare all those instances' JVM metrics collected by OpenTelemetry instrumentation using timeseries charts to spot problems.

Here's a typical workflow:

1. Click **JVMs**.
2. Find interesting JVMs using the table of summarized health metrics:
   * Use the filter bar to narrow down your search.
   * Sort to find outliers.
3. Select those interesting JVMs.
4. Click **Compare** to see a display of the health and runtime metrics faceted by JVM.

Review these additional topics about using the JVMs page:

    When you drill into a specific JVM, the UI display charts driven by JVM metric data. The Java specific runtime metrics are not well documented. The [implementation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/runtime-metrics/library/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/instrumentation/runtimemetrics) is effectively the documentation and may be subject to change.

    For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

    * A unique `service.instance.id` attribute for rendering the list of JVMs.
    * An OpenTelemetry resource attribute `service.instance.id`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="jvms-and-metric-types"
    title="Gauges versus counters"
  >
    Starting in OpenTelemetry Java agent 1.10.0, JVM memory usage switched from being collected as an async gauge to an async up down counter. This has implications on the exported data. Gauges and counters export differently:

    * Async gauges export as OTLP gauges.

    * Async up down counters export as OTLP non-monotonic sums.

      If you configure your SDK to export your metrics using delta aggregation temporality (which is required for counter and histogram instruments to function with New Relic), that results in async up down counters exported as non-monotonic delta sums. New Relic can't perform any useful analysis of non-monotonic delta sum data.

      The solution for now (until a better solution is sorted out in the OpenTelemetry metric specification) is to use the View API to indicate that async up down counters should be aggregated using [last value aggregation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#last-value-aggregation) instead of the default sum aggregation. This results in JVM memory usage being exported as gauge data, which is required for a useful experience in New Relic.

      The way you configure the View API varies based on whether you’re using the OpenTelemetry Java agent:

    * If you're not using the OpenTelemetry Java agent, review this simple [example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/pull/89/files#diff-da355ef6d1092534a55829e95160ab8468884bdd521f9018feeaaa66aea6ac5bR82-R86) that shows how to register a view when configuring `SdkMeterProvider`.

    * If you’re using the OpenTelemetry Java agent, you need to configure the View API in an [extension](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/agent-config.md#extensions). Extensions allow you to hook into the SDK configuration (among other things) and apply programmatic configuration that isn’t available by environment variable or system properties. This [example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/java/agent-nr-config) demonstrates how you can use an extension to [customize](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/blob/main/java/agent-nr-config/config-extension/src/main/java/com/newrelic/otel/extension/Customizer.java#L28-L37) the `SdkMeterProvider`’s views.

</CollapserGroup>

### Logs [#logs]

The **Logs** page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our [OpenTelemetry and logging documentation](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-logs).

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

* `service.name`
* To correlate with trace data, the logs should contain the `trace.id` and `span.id` attributes.

### Metrics explorer [#metric-explorer]

For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here.

<img
  title="Screen shot showing the metric explorer"
  alt="Screen shot showing the metric explorer"
  src={metricExplorer}
/>

### Transactions [#transactions]

Use **Transactions** to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the **Transaction Summary** page, select the transactions table.

New Relic's notion of a [transaction](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm#txn-defined) encapsulates one logical unit of work in a software application - generally, this is work performed by a single process.

With OpenTelemetry, we rely on [`SpanKind`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#spankind) for mapping trace data to New Relic's concept of a transaction. A `SpanKind` of `server` or `consumer` is used to identify the entry point of a process - that is, these are spans that are either root spans or child spans of a remote process.

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        UI area
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Top Transactions
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
        * Facets by span name
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Throughput
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
        * Facets by span name
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Data explorer and query builder [#query-builder]

Explore your metrics and traces using the [data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer), or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL. For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/explore-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).
