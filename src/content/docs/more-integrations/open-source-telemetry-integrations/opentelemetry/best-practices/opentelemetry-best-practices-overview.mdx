OpenTelemetry can be complex, so to make sure you're optimizing your experience with New Relic, review our best practices. For information about resolving specific issues, see our [troubleshooting guide](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-troubleshooting).

* [Alerts](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-alerts): Notify yourself about problems by using alerts
* [Attribute lengths](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-attributes): Stay within the limits for attribute names and values
* [Batching](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-batching): Use batching to avoid rate limiting
* [Compression](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-compression): Maximize your payloads
* [Logs](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs): Send logs to New Relic using OpenTelemetry tooling
* [Metrics](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-metrics): Explore how OpenTelemetry metrics are processed in New Relic
* [Resources](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-resources): Use resources for the entity generating telemetry data
* [Traces](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-traces): See some requirements and options for traces and spans

<Callout variant="important">
Now that OpenTelemetry protocol for metrics is stable, we intend to move our support from v0.10 to v0.16. This means we'll be ending support for removed fields and data types, including the `Int` data point types for metrics, `LogRecord.Name` for logs, and status code for traces.

Other significant changes include the renaming of `InstrumentationLibrary` to `InstrumentationScope`. We recommend you upgrade your collector or instrumentation if you depend on removed or deprecated features. We expect to make this change during or after the week of April 18, 2022.
