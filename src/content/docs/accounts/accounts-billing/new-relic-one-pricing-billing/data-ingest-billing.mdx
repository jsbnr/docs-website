metaDescription: For New Relic One pricing, an explanation of how data ingest is calculated for billing purposes. 
---

For [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), data ingest is one billing factor.

## View data ingest in the UI [#ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

## Data ingest calculation [#usage-calculation]

For the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), “ingested data” refers to the data saved for your New Relic organization after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored.

Here are some notes about New Relic features and data that **do not** count towards ingest and billing:

* [Basic alerting functionality](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) doesn't count towards billing.
* [Applied intelligence](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-applied-intelligence) data reported from third-party services counts towards billing but internally generated data (for example, `NrIncidentEvent` data) does not.
* Usage-tracking data (for example, `NrUsage`, `NrMTDConsumption`, `NrConsumption`) doesn't count towards billing.
* Data related to organization and account administration (for example, `NrIntegrationError`, `NrAuditEvent`) doesn't count towards billing.

To see details about your usage, go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

Other calculation details:

* In the context of New Relic One pricing, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs.
