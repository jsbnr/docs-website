Designate a few explicit roles and practices in order to ensure a level of context and accountability in your ingest planning.  At a minimum designate a _Governance Team_ and schedule check-ins throughout the year to plan and adapt as needed.

## Stakeholders and participants [#stakeholders]

Regardless of how your organization's teams are structured it is necessary to identify some individuals who will participate in the data governance process.  Selection of the team can be ad hoc but it should include representation from a broad enough cross section of teams so that when priorities and decisions must be made you will have the right stakeholders.  The team should have one individual who can be considered the overall observability manager.  This may be the person who manages the New Relic account or an overriding team leader responsible for the systems and infrastructure monitored by New Relic.

### Observability manager [#manager]

/>

This is the go-to person to help resolve conflicts and to communicate with senior management as needed.  When the organization contains gray areas of ownership leading to questions like _"Who owns this kubernetes cluster?"_ this individual is instrumental.

### The governance team [#governance-team]

/>

The _Observability manager_ functions as the lead for this team.  The members of this team bring in practical technical knowledge of the systems and services that are monitored in New Relic.  They may be peers of the observability manager so collaboration is key.
If you have a pre-existing structure such as an Observability Center of Excellence (OCoE) your governance team can be comprised primarily from the _OCoE Core Team_.

The primary responsibilities of a OCoE team generally are:

* Maintain the relationship with New Relic.
* Govern accounts and users.
* Onboard new teams and individuals.
* Maintain an observability knowledge base.
* Promote collaboration and sharing among teams.

Incorporating data governance adds the following responsibilities:

* Work with the observability manager to stay within monthly ingest targets.
* Monitor data ingest baselines and respond to anomalies.
* Draft and approve plans for data optimization/reduction as needed.
* Participate in scheduled check-ins where baseline data is analyzed and compared to ingest targets.
* Make modifications to ingest targets as needed.

## Timelines and check ins [#timelines]

Schedule data ingest governance meetings through the year to keep everyone up to date on data ingest volumes. Doing so makes data ingest governance predictable and easy to manage.

### Yearly ingest target planning [#ingest-target]

Meet to maintain an organization wide telemetry ingest target.  This can be broken out into as many facets as is useful for your organization.  For example you may adopt the following ingest targets...

* Organization Wide (Monthly): 1000TB
* Team A (Monthly): 500TB
* Team B (Monthly): 300TB
* Team C (Monthly): 100TB

This rough set of targets leaves 100TB as a buffer for uncertainty. You may also choose some specific limits based on certain highly variable telemetry. For example you may set organization or team based limits on Log or Metrics ingest.

### Monthly ingest check-ins [#check-ins]

  style={{ height: '66px', width: '75px', verticalAlign: 'middle'}}
/>

During these sessions you'll track ingest against your plan and produce action items needed to stay on target.

### Ad hoc anomaly resolution [#ad-hoc]

Occasionally a system refactor or organizational change could lead to an unexpected increase in data ingest.  In this scenario it may be necessary to call a meeting to address the specific topic.  Some scenarios to watch for:

* A new software deployment increases log volume by 3x.
* A team enables a handful of new cloud integrations that unexpectedly increases metrics ingest by 200%.
* An acquisition of a new company leads to an increase in overall telemetry volume.
* Peak business season activity combined with some pre-peak refactors results in a higher than expected custom events volume.
