In this stage it is necessary to get a high level view of all of the telemetry currently being generated by your organization.  The unit focuses on breaking down ingest stats into various groups such as account, telemetry type, and application.  These figures will be used to inform the [Optimize your ingest data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-optimizing) and [Forecast your ingest data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-growth) stages.

You'll learn how to generate a structured breakdown report for the following dimensions:

* Organization
* Sub account
* Billable Telemetry Type

In addition you'll learn how to create highly granular breakdowns including:

* Application (APM|Browser|Mobile)
* K8s Cluster
* Infrastructure Integration

## Desired outcome [#desired-outcome]

Understand exactly which groups within the org are contributing which types of data and how much.

    All billable telemetry is tracked in the `NrConsumption` and `NrMTDConsumption` event types. This guide focuses on how to query the `NrConsumption` event type, which provides more granular, real time data than `NrMTDConsumption`. The `NrConsumption` attribute `usageMetric` denotes the telemetry type.

    Using `NrConsumption` you can ask questions like "How much browser data has each sub-account ingested in the last 30 days?  How has the ingest changed since the previous 30 days?"

    ```sql
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE usageMetric = 'BrowserEventsBytes' SINCE 30 days AGO COMPARE WITH 30 days AGO FACET consumingAccountName
    ```

    The response shows you how many GBs of Browser data you've ingested by account.

    ```shell
    Banking Platform, 75 GB, +2.9%
    Marketing Platform, 40 GB, -1.3%
    ```

    Below is a breakdown of the different `usageMetric` types, the constituent events (event types where the data is stored), and the type of agent or mechanism responsible for creating the data ingest.

    Under New Relic's consumption model, telemetry data and users both contribute to your consumption. This guide is focused on maximizing the value of telemetry data. The mention of users in this section is to help you understand different options for balancing users and data.

    There are three general types of usage plans. Your usage plan may affect how you set ingest targets for your organization.

    ### APoF

    If you have an `Annual Pool of Funds` (APoF) agreement you'll likely have a monthly target budget for data ingest. For example, you may have set a target of 5TB per day and 100 FSO users. In this type of plan data, users can be "traded off" but it's best to discuss this with other stakeholders in your organization to ensure you're getting the right mix for your observability goals. Although some customers will plan for variability in their consumption during the year, let's assume for now our monthly consumption budget is your APoF / 12.

    If you know the number of FSO and Core users you need you can use this formula:

    ```sql
    (monthly_target_spend - (num_fso_users*per_fso_cost) - (num_core_users*per_core_cost))/0.25
    ```

    _Divide by $0.25 in order to convert to get our monthly GB ingest target._

    ### Pay As You Go

    In a pay as you go plan you will not have a predetermined yearly commit however, you will likely have an understood limit to your monthly spend. In this model you would take the following to determine your target ingest:

    ```sql
    (monthly_target_spend - (num_fso_users*per_fso_cost) - (num_core_users*per_core_cost))/0.25
    ```

    _Divide by $0.25 in order to convert to get our monthly GB ingest target._

    ### Free tier

    The perpetual free tier allows for up to 100GB data ingest per month. If you are currently working in a free tier account you can consider 100GB your monthly ingest target. In a free tier account any additional data ingested over 100GB per month will be billed at $0.25 per GB.

          Use the `rate` operator when you need to take a sample of data pulled from a certain time period and produce a given rate.  For example, take a daily sample of data and compute a 30 day rate based on that.
        </Callout>

        _Compute rate based on a given sample of data_

        See what your daily average ingest has been for the past month.

        ```sql
        SELECT rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) AS 'Daily Ingest Rate (GB)' FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' LIMIT MAX SINCE 30 days AGO
        ```

        Our simple response for the entire organization is

        ```shell
        Daily Ingest Rate: 30.4 k
        ```

        This query shows that the daily ingest rate was approximately 30 TB per day for the last month.

          When it's important to constrain an ingest calculation to specific calendar months.  For example ingest for an integration may have increased in late January and continued through mid February.  This operator will help facet the ingest to the specific calendar months used for billing.
        </Callout>

        _Facet by calendar month_

        ```sql
        SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) AS 'Daily Ingest Rate (GB)' FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' FACET monthOf(timestamp) LIMIT MAX SINCE 56 weeks AGO
        ```

        The resulting table shows fairly high variability.  Note that things were fairly `hot` in August and September.  Some of that is our organization seasonality but also was related to some increasing the breadth of our telemetry coverage.

        ```shell
        |MONTH OF TIMESTAMP|GB INGESTED|
        |---|---|
        |December 2021*|636 k|
        |November 2021|901 k|
        |October 2021|873 k|
        |September 2021|1.05 M|
        |August 2021|1.08 M|
        |July 2021|1.05 M|
        |June 2021|887 k|

          When you want to evaluate the amount of change in ingest volume or rate between one time period in another.  This is important to know if your ingest is creeping up unexpectedly.
        </Callout>

        _Simple Change Analysis_

        ```sql

        Telemetry is inherently noisy.  Real world phenomena happen in spurts leaving many random peaks and troughs in the signal.  This is good in a way since it lets us view the full complexity of a phenomenon.  However when we are seeking to see trends we can be distracted by detail.  NRQL provides a powerful way to smoothing out any time series by combining each data point with slightly older points  This let's us focus on the overall temporal trend rather than one extreme `increase` or `decrease`.

        Note the jaggedness of the raw timeseries for 1 day ingest rate:

        ```sql
        FROM NrConsumption SELECT rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 26 weeks AGO TIMESERIES 1 DAY
        ```

        <img
            src={slidingwindowjaggedexample}
            alt="Daily rate time series without smoothing."

        />
        <figcaption>
            Daily rate time series **without** smoothing
        </figcaption>


        Now if we use a [sliding window](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/create-smoother-charts-sliding-windows/) of 4 days to reduce the impact of single day events we will see a clearer picture.  Four days is a good choice since it will blur the impact of `weekends` so data for a Sunday will be combined somewhat with data for a Friday etc.

        ```sql
        FROM NrConsumption SELECT rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' since 26 weeks ago TIMESERIES 1 DAY SLIDE BY 4 days
        ```

        <img

            title="Daily rate time series with smoothing."
        />

          Use to estimate the statistical rate of change over a given time period.  The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative
        </Callout>

        NRQL provides us with some tools to assess the rate of change.  This is useful since as we see in the previous example we had a very large increase over the past several months in browser metrics.  This rate of change analysis uses the `derivative` operator and it gives us some confidence that the main growth happened back in early September.  It seems as though our growth rate based on the 7 day derivative is somewhat negative so we may have reached a new plateau at the moment in BrowserEventsBytes ingest.

        ```sql
        SELECT derivative(sum(GigabytesIngested) , 7 day) FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'  and usageMetric = 'BrowserEventsBytes'  LIMIT MAX SINCE 3 MONTHS AGO UNTIL THIS MONTH TIMESERIES 1 MONTH slide by 3 days COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO
        ```

          >
            ProcessSample can be quite a high volume event.  In this example we'll compute the 30 day ingest per command line.

            _Estimate 30 day rate by command name_

            ```sql
            FROM ProcessSample SELECT rate(bytecountestimate()/10e8, 30 day) AS 'GB Ingested' FACET commandName SINCE 1 DAY AGO
            ```

      >
        <Callout
          variant="important"
          title="When to use"
        >
          Use the `entityType()` operator when you need to have event level granularity in your query and when you are unfamiliar with what custom events are present in your account.
        </Callout>

        Often times we'll use a query that selects multiple events. This one of the primary means we have to determine how much data a given agent or integration is sending us.

        The following query tells us how much data the K8s integration is sending us:

        ```sql
        FROM
        K8sApiServerSample,
        K8sClusterSample,
        K8sContainerSample,
        K8sControllerManagerSample,
        K8sDaemonsetSample,
        K8sDeploymentSample,
        K8sEndpointSample,
        K8sNamespaceSample,
        K8sNodeSample,
        K8sPodSample,
        K8sReplicasetSample,
        K8sSchedulerSample,
        K8sServiceSample,
        K8sStatefulsetSample,
        K8sVolumeSample
        SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 AS 'Gigabytes'
        SINCE 1 DAYS AGO
        LIMIT MAX
        ```

        It's powerful in itself, but it'll only return a single aggregate value:

        ```shell
        42.341 Gigabytes
        ```

        When we need to drill deeper to know how much data specific event is consuming, we can use `entityType()` in a facet clause to get that result.
        Adding the clause `FACET entityType()` to the previous query gives us:

        <img
            src={entitytypeexample}
            alt="Listing of ingest by K8s event type"
            title="Listing of ingest by K8s event type"
        />
        <figcaption>

        >
          Use `SHOW EVENT TYPES` when you are uncertain of exactly which events exist in your account.
        </Callout>

        `SHOW EVENT TYPES` lists all event types in an account for a given time period. Read about [SHOW EVENT TYPES](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#show-event-types) for more detail. Using a specific time window can be useful to better understand when a given event started to come into the system.

          Use `FACET metricName` when you need metricName level granularity in your query.
        </Callout>

        The best way to really explore Metrics and get a sense of the relative volume of data coming from each is to use `FACET metricName` on a `SELECT FROM Metric` query.  It's possible to incorporate where clauses to narrow the list down.  For example to view the relative ingest volume for metris with the text `kube_pod` in `metricName` run a query like this

        ```sql
        SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'Gigabytes' from Metric facet metricName where metricName like '%kube_pod%' since 1 day ago limit max
        ```

## Process [#process]

[Install the data governance baseline dashboard](#install-dashboard)  
[Add ingest target indicators to your dashboard](#add-target-indicators)  
[Generate a tabular 30 day ingest report](#generate-report)  
[Customize your report](#customize-report)  
[Detect ingest anomalies](#detect-anomalies)  
[Install the entity breakdown dashboard (Optional)](#install-entity-breakdown-dashboard)  
[Install the cloud integration dashboard (optional)](#install-cloud-integration-dashboard)

### Install the data governance baseline dashboard [#install-dashboard]

1. Navigate to the [data governance quickstart](https://onenr.io/0PoR8zpDYQG).
2. Click `Install this quickstart` in the upper right portion of your browser window.
3. Select your top level master account or POA account in the account drop down.
4. Click `Done` since there is no agent to install.
5. When the quickstart is done installing, open the `Data Governance Baseline` dashboard.

That will bring you to the newly installed dashboard.

#### Dashboard Overview [#dashboard-overview]

The main overview tab shows a variety of charts including some powerful time series views.

        <img
            src={orgwidebaselineview}
            alt="Organization wide baseline ingest time series"
            title="Organization wide baseline ingest time series"
        />
        <figcaption>
            Organization wide baseline ingest time series
        </figcaption>

The second tab provides a baseline report by sub-account and usage metric.

        <img
            src={orgwidetabularview}
            alt="Organization wide baseline tabular view"
            title="Organization wide baseline tabular view"
        />
        <figcaption>
            Organization wide baseline tabular view
        </figcaption>

The remaining tabs provide detailed views of specific telemetry types such as browser data, apm data, logs, and traces.  For example this screenshot shows the browser detail page

        <img
            src={baselinebrowserdetail}
            alt="Baseline Browser ingest"
            title="Baseline Browser ingest"
        />
        <figcaption>
            Example of an ingest detail focused on a single telemetry type (in this case Browser data)
        </figcaption>


Detail tabs include:

* APM: `ApmEventsBytes`
* Tracing: `TracingBytes`
* Browser: `BrowserEventsBytes`
* Mobile: `MobileEventsBytes`
* Infra (Host): `InfraHostBytes`
* Infra (Process):`InfraProcessBytes`
* Infra (Integration): `InfraIntegrationBytes`
* Custom Events: `CustomEventsBytes`
* Serverless: `ServerlessBytes`
* Pixie: `PixieBytes`

<Callout variant="caution">
  If you are using a POA account, be aware that the POA account itself  will not be included in facets by `consumingAccountName`.  Thats because the POA account receives no actual telemetry.  If you install the dashboard into a normal parent account the consumption value of that parent account is the `sum` of data ingested directly to the parent account and data sent to any sub-accounts.  
        For example, when faceting on monthly ingest you may see something like:

  * Parent Account Ingest: 100GB
  * Sub Account 1 Ingest: 50GB
  * Sub Account 2 Ingest: 20GB
    Where `Parent Account Ingest` includes data for sub accounts 1 and 2 and an additional 30GB that is sent directly to the parent account.
</Callout>

### Add ingest target indicators to your dashboard [#add-target-indicators]

In the prerequisites section we discussed the concept of a monthly usage target.  You may actually have several targets to help keep you on track:

* An overall organizational target on daily rate or monthly ingest.
* Targets per data type to ensure the optimal breakdown (for example 1 TB per day for logs and 2 TB per day for metrics).
* Targets for specific sub-accounts or business units.

In our example we have an organization that targets their total organizational ingest to `<` 360 TB per month.  This was a new target after having reduced ingest down from over 20TB per day (600 TB per month).

To make the target easier to measure against we added a threshold line chart by adding the static number `360000` to our `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT 360000, rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 30 day) AS '30 Day Rate' FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine='DataPlatform' since 30 days ago limit max compare with 1 month ago TIMESERIES 7 days
```

        <img
            src={thirydayratetargetline}
            alt="Thirty day ingest target line"
            title="Thirty day ingest target line"
        />
        <figcaption>
            We an use NRQL to render a line representing our target thirty day ingest **target**.
        </figcaption>

We can also apply a daily rate target line.   Let's just divide 360000 by 30 and we'll use 12000 as our daily rate target.  Update the `Daily Ingest Rate (Compare With 3 Months Prior)` chart:

```sql
SELECT 12000, rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) AS avgGbIngestTimeseries FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine='DataPlatform' TIMESERIES AUTO since 9 months ago limit max COMPARE WITH 3 months ago
```

        <img
            src={dailyratetargetline}
            alt="Daily ingest target line"
            title="Daily ingest target line"
        />
        <figcaption>
            We an use NRQL to render a line representing our daily ingest **target**.
        </figcaption>

### Generate a tabular 30 day ingest report [#generate-report]

1. Open the previously installed _Data governance baseline_ dashboard.
2. Click on the _Baseline report_ tab.
3. Click on `...` in the upper right of the "Last 30 Days" table and choose `Export as CSV`
4. Import the CSV into _Google Sheets_ or the spreadsheet of your choice.

Alternatively, if you didn't install the dashboard, you may simply use this query to create a custom chart in [Query Builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/):

```sql
SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) AS 'gb_ingest_30_day_sum', rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) AS 'gb_ingest_daily_rate', derivative(GigabytesIngested, 90 day) as 'gb_ingest_90_day_derivative' FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine='DataPlatform' since 30 days ago facet consumingAccountName, usageMetric  limit max
```

Below is an example of a sheet we imported into Google Sheets.

        <img
            src={baselinetabularspreadsheet}
            alt="Baseline tabular spreadsheet"
            title="Screenshot of a baseline report example"
        />
        <figcaption>
            A spreadsheet exported from the baseline dashboard tabular page
        </figcaption>

The screenshot shows the table sorted by 30 day ingest total.

Feel free to adjust your timeline and some of the details as needed.  For example, we chose to extract a _90 day derivative_ to have some sense of change over the past few months.  You could easily alter the time period of the derivative to suit your objectives.

### Customize your report [#customize-report]

Add useful columns to your report in order to facilitate other phases of data governance such as _optimize_ and _forecast_.  The following fields will help guide optimization and planning decisions:

* Notes: Note any growth anomalies and any relevant explanations for them.  Indicate any major expected growth if foreseen.
* Technical Contact: Name of the manager of a given sub-account or someone related to a specific telemetry type.

### Detect ingest anomalies [#detect-anomalies]

#### Alert on ingest anomalies [#on-ingest-anomalies]

Use [this ingest alerts guide](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts/) to make sure that an increase in data consumption doesn't catch you by surprise.
At a minimum, create:

* A threshold alert to notify if you exceed monthly targets for data ingest beyond seasonal increases
* A baseline alert to notify you of a sudden sharp increase ingest data

In addition to using alerts to identify consumption anomalies, you can use lookout to explore potential ingest anomalies.

#### Lookout View [#lookout]

Lookout allows you to provide nearly any NRQL query and it will search for anomalies over a given period of time.
This view is based on the query

```sql
SELECT rate(sum(GigabytesIngested), 1 day) AS avgGbIngest FROM NrConsumption WHERE productLine='DataPlatform' FACET usageMetric 
```

        <img
            src={lookoutviewusagemetric}
            alt="Lookout view usage metric"
            title="Lookout view usage metric"
        />
        <figcaption>
            We can use **Lookout** to find anomaly in our ingest by **usageMetric**
        </figcaption>

Change the facet field to `consumingAcountName` to get this view:

        <img
            src={lookoutviewconsumingaccont}
            alt="Lookout view consuming account"
            title="Lookout view consuming account"
        />
        <figcaption>
            We can use **Lookout** to find anomaly in our ingest by **consumingAccountName**
        </figcaption>

### Install the entity breakdown dashboard (Optional) [#install-entity-breakdown-dashboard]

In a previous section you installed the ingest `baseline` dashboard that uses NrConsumption as its primary source. In addition to that high level view you can create other visualizations that use `bytescountestimate()` to estimate ingest for nearly any event or metric.  A detailed overview of `bytescountestimate()` was discussed [in the prerequisites section](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining#baseline-query-examples).

1. Go to the [same quickstart](https://onenr.io/0PoR8zpDYQG) you used for the baseline dashboard.
2. Click `Install this quickstart` in the upper right section of your browser window.
3. Don't install this instance of the dashboard into a POA account.  Instead, install it into any account that contains APM, Browser, Mobile applications or K8s clusters [import dashboard function](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-import).  You can install this dashboard into multiple accounts.  You can install it into a top-level parent account and modify the dashboard so you have account-specific charts all in one dashboard.
4. Click `Done` since there is no agent to install.
5. When the quickstart is done installing open the `Data Governance Entity Breakdowns` dashboard.

    <img
        src={entitybreakdowndash}
        alt="Entity breakdown dashboard"
        title="Entity breakdown dashboard"
    />
    <figcaption>
        The entity breakdown dashboard uses **bytecountestimate()** to facet ingest by useful attributes such as application or cluster name
    </figcaption>

You can refer back to [this section](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining#understand-nr-consumption-metrics) to see exactly which event types are used in these breakdowns.

<Callout variant="tip">
  These queries consume more resources because they don't work from a pre-aggregated data source like `NrConsumption`. You may need to adjust the time frames by using additional `where` and `limit` clauses to make them work better in some of your environments.
</Callout>

### Install the cloud integration dashboard (optional) [#install-cloud-integration-dashboard]

Cloud Integrations can often be a significant source of data ingest growth.  Without good visualizations it can be very difficult to pinpoint where the growth is coming from.  This is partly because these integrations are so easy to configure and they are not part of an organization's normal CI/CD pipeline. They may also not be part of a formal configuration management system.
Fortunately this powerful set of dashboards can be installed [directly from New Relic I/O](https://onenr.io/0EPwJJO9Ow7).
Individual dashboards installed by this package include:

* AWS Integrations
* Azure Integrations
* GCP Integrations
* On-Host Integrations
* Kubernetes

<img

    alt="Infra integrations dashboard"
    title="Infra integrations dashboard"
/>
<figcaption>
    This [quickstart](https://onenr.io/0EPwJJO9Ow7) contains a highly granular set of dashboard breaking down data by nearly every cloud integration, on-host integration, as well as the K8s integration

## Exercise [#exercise]

Answering the following questions will help you develop confidence in your ability to interpret baseline data and make correct inferences.  These questions can be answered using the [Data Ingest Baseline](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining#install-dashboard) and [Data Ingest Entity Breakdown](http://localhost:8000/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining#install-entity-breakdown-dashboard) dashboards.  Install those dashboards as described and see how many of these questions you can answer.

## Conclusion [#conclusion]

The [process](#process) section took you through the creation of data ingest visualizations and reports. You can now review data ingest with a data driven visual approach that you and your peers can use to collaborate around.

Going forward, decide which visualizations to use for:

* For [monthly ingest check-ins](docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-coe#monthly-ingest-check-ins)
* For [yearly ingest planning meetings](docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-coe#yearly-ingest-target-planning)
* As best practice visualizations for anyone managing data ingest for one or more sub-accounts
