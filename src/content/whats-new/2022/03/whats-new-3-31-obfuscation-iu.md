New Relic makes it easy for you to ensure data privacy and follow your organization's logs security guidelines with new obfuscation options now available in Logs.
 
Define regular expressions to mask or hash data you want to protect and easily create custom rules before sensitive information is being stored, all directly available in the Logs user interface without the need for lengthy manual configurations.
 
Try it out:
 
1. Go to [**Logs**](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) in New Relic One and from the left nav, select **Obfuscation**.
 
2. Select **Create expression** or **Create obfuscation rule** to get started.
