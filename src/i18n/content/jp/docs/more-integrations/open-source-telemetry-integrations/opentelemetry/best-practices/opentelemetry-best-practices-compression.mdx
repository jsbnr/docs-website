metaDescription: Here are some tips for working with OpenTelemetry compression and New Relic.

New Relic supports gzip compression for OTLP payloads transported via gRPC or HTTP. The maximum allowed payload size is 1MB (10^6 bytes). To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the [CNCF Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C024DRQ63UP).
